Hi there 👋 
I am Joel, a Master's student in the Elmore School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue. I pursued my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (BTech.) from IIT Palakkad. Post completion of my Bachelor's, I was a researcher at the Indian Institute of Science.
 🔭 I’m currently working on Explainable AI and Deep Learning with a slight focus on Medical Imaging.
